Red Bull Racing Website

This is a sample website template for Red Bull Racing, a Formula 1 team. It includes information about the team, its key members, and some interesting facts. 
Below are the details and instructions on how to use and customize this template.

We learned so many new concepts like:
@media screen
footer elements
User input

Which helped us in making our project responsive to all screen sizes.

We loved this project because it was so close to us.

Thank you to Professor Nina for giving us the chance to show our creativity.
