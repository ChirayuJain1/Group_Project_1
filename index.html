        <h1>Red Bull Racing Team</h1>
        <p class="about-team">Oracle Red Bull Racing, founded by Red Bull founder Dietrich Mateschitz, has been a force in Formula 1 since its debut in 2005. The team has made significant strides in the sport, winning multiple titles and establishing itself as a maverick force. In 2008, Sebastian Vettel replaced David Coulthard as the team's youngest principal, leading to a major shift in regulations. Vettel won the RB5 in 2009, and the team finished second in the Constructors' Championship.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2010, Webber and Vettel became title contenders, winning the Constructors' Championship at the penultimate round in Brazil. In 2011, the team won 11 of the team's dozen victories and secured the Constructors' title with four races remaining. In 2013, Vettel added another record with nine consecutive victories, securing both titles at the Indian Grand Prix.
          <br>
          <br>
          The 2014 season saw the introduction of hybrid power units, which led to a lack of competitive edge for the RB10 car. However, Daniel Ricciardo and Alex Albon continued to win, securing the team's third-place finishes in the Constructors' Championship. In 2019, the team ended an 11-year association with Renault and partnered with Honda for power unit supply. Pierre Gasly took his first Honda-powered victory at the Red Bull Ring in Austria, followed by a third win in Brazil.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2020, the team faced a shift in driver line-up, with Sergio 'Checo' Pérez coming in and Alex Albon becoming the Test and Reserve Driver. Max Verstappen led the team with 12 podium finishes, including victories at the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix at Silverstone and the season finale in Abu Dhabi.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2022, the Oracle Red Bull Racing RB18 led the way, with Max taking victory at Round 2 in Saudi Arabia and a staggering 16 more wins over the next 20 races. With the RB18 providing a winning platform for the next phase of Formula 1 competition, the future looks bright.</p>

    <!--Fact 2-->
    <div class="fact-2">
      <img src="Resources/Max.jpg" alt="Image of max verstappen">
      <div class="fact-2-text">
        <h1>Max Verstappen</h1>
        <p class="about-fact-2">The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and Belgian kart champion Sophie Kumpen, Max was always destined to race and from the moment Max first took the wheel of a go-kart, aged four, it was clear that the only route he was interested in was the quickest way to the top.
          <br>
          <br>
          The Dutch driver took the karting world by storm, winning national, international and world titles. Then, having reached the required age he moved into single-seaters for the 2014 season, contesting the FIA European Formula 3 Championship.
          <br>
          <br>
          Against more experienced opposition Max won 10 races on his way to third place overall. He had, however, planned his next move long before the conclusion of his debut single-seater season and in August 2014, 16-year-old Max joined the Red Bull Junior Team and was announced as a 2015 race driver for Toro Rosso.
          <br>
          <br>
          After three FP1 appearances in 2014 and a short winter testing programme, Max made his Grand Prix debut at the 2015 Australian Grand Prix, aged 17 years and 166 days – the youngest driver in the history of the sport. Two weeks after that he grabbed another record, becoming F1’s youngest points-scorer with seventh place in Malaysia.
          <br>
          <br>
          A second season with Red Bull’s junior squad began in style with three points finishes from his first three races. The talent to challenge for bigger prizes was clear and after that year’s the Russian Grand Prix, Max was drafted into the Red Bull Racing line-up.
          <br>
          <br>
          His impact was nothing short of spectacular. On his Team debut at the Spanish Grand Prix he qualified fourth and drove an immaculate race to claim his first F1 victory and became the sport’s youngest race winner – despite confessing he was not entirely sure what all the buttons on the steering wheel did.
          <br>
          <br>
          Over the course of the following four seasons Max firmly established himself as a major star of the sport and as a regular race winner. And as the Team journeyed steadily back to sustained competitiveness, Max emerged as a genuine title contender.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2020 he finished third in the Drivers’ Championship, taking victories at the 70th Anniversary Grand Prix at Silverstone and the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The victories were supported by remarkable consistency, as he finished on the podium 11 times from the 12 races in which he saw the chequered flag.
          <br>
          <br>
          With momentum building and with the bulk of the 2020 car carried over to the following year, the stage was set for Max to make his first serious bid for championship glory in 2021.
          <br>
          <br>
          Across a hard-fought campaign Max took the fight to a dominant Mercedes team and wins in Imola, Monaco, Paul Ricard and Spielberg in Austria propelled the Dutchman into an intense battle with seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton.
          <br>
          <br>
          After the summer break Max won the half-points Belgian Grand Prix and delighted his home crowd with a dominant win at Zandvoort as the Dutch Grand Prix returned for the first time since 1985. A brilliant US Grand Prix win in October was followed a week later by Max’s third Mexican Grand Prix in four years and he looked set to march to title glory.
          <br>
          <br>
          Hamilton bounced back, however, with a trio of wins, in Brazil, Qatar and Saudi Arabia and an epic season went down to the wire at a nail-biting showdown in Abu Dhabi.

    <!--Fact 3-->
    <div class="fact-3">
      <img src="Resources/Perez 1.jpeg" alt="Image of Sergio Perez">
      <div class="fact-3-text">
        <h1>Sergio Perez</h1>
        <p class="about-fact-3">Sergio Pérez has forged a place in the top echelon of F1 racers through a combination of grit, tenacity and pace, along the way becoming Mexico’s most successful Formula One driver.
          <br>
          <br>
          After moving, on his own, from Mexico to Germany at the tender age of 14 to race in Formula BMW, the driver from Guadalajara rose swiftly through the junior categories to eventually claim the runner-up spot in the 2010 GP2 standings.
          <br>
          <br>
          That earned Checo the call to F1 and he made F1 debut in 2011 with Sauber. He soon forged a reputation as a serial podium finisher and the undisputed master of Pirelli tyres and he scored three top-three finishes in 2012.
          <br>
          <br>
          His performances earned him a move to McLaren for 2013 but in a troubled year for the team, his stay was short and at the end of the season he switched to Force India where he would spend the next five years, taking five podiums before the team was sold and rebranded as Racing Point.
          <br>
          <br>
          It was with Racing Point that Checo scored his first F1 victory. Dropped to the back of the field after a lap-one collision at the 2020 Sakhir Grand Prix, Checo staged a stunning fightback to power through the field and take a remarkable win.
          <br>
          <br>
          The victory proved crucial for Checo in securing his F1 future. With Racing Point set to replace him for 2021, Checo was in danger of dropping off the grid. But as the season ended the seat opposite Max became available and the Team pounced, prizing the Mexican driver’s experience, race craft and pace.
          <br>
          <br>
          Checo’s first season with the team proved to be both tricky and triumphant. Adapting to new machinery took some time but Checo made swift progress and in Baku, the Mexican took a superb first win after a dramatic restart in the closing stages of the race.
          <br>
          <br>
          He also proved himself to be one of F1’s great team players at the final round in Abu Dhabi, where a brilliant defensive drive on aging tyres saw him fend-off repeated attacks by reigning World Champion Lewis Hamilton. His resilience allowed Max Verstappen to close the gap enough to take advantage of a late race Safety Car and win the race and the 2021 Drivers’ title. His stirring refusal to buckle under pressure promptly earned Checo a new nickname as ‘the Mexican Minister of Defence’.
          <br>
          <br>
          Checo hasn’t looked back since. In his second season at the Team, along with his unrivalled defensive and race management skills he proved himself to be one of the sport’s great street fighters with victories in Monaco and Singapore and claimed his best championship finish ever, in third, and with his largest ever points haul of 305.
          <br>
          <br>
          Now firmly settled in the Team, our Mexican Minister of Defence is ready to level up again by going on the offensive and battling for even more podiums, wins and the fighting for the ultimate prize.

      <img src="Resources/adrian_newey.jpeg" alt="Image of Adrian Newey OBE">
      <div class="fact-4-text">
        <h1>Adrian Newey</h1>
        <p class="about-fact-4">Adrian Newey, the most successful designer in Formula 1 history, has won 11 Constructors' Titles and propelled some of the sport's most iconic racers to Drivers' Championship success. After studying aeronautics at Southampton University and having stints with Fittipaldi and March F1 Teams, Newey first tasted success in the United States with his March sports car design winning IMSA’s GTP class in 1983 and 1984. His IndyCar project, the March 85C, won the CART Championship and the Indy 500 in both ‘86 and ‘87. However, F1 was calling, and Newey joined Red Bull Racing in 2006 with the aim of elevating the Team to championship contention.
          <br>
          <br>
          In 2009, Newey's RB5 provided an excellent development platform for a generation of Red Bull cars that would dominate the sport. In 2010, the RB6 took the Team's first Constructors' title with nine wins and 20 podiums, and with Sebastian Vettel at the wheel, the Drivers' title was also secured. Over the following three seasons, the Newey/Vettel combination raced to three more championship doubles.
          <br>
          <br>
          After the dawn of the 1.5 litre V6 turbo hybrid era, Adrian stepped back from day-to-day racing matters but was keenly felt in the design phase of each of the Team's cars. In 2019, he presided over the design of the RB16, which won two races and 13 podium finishes. The rapidly evolving RB18 proved to be an increasingly dominant force, with Max Verstappen sealing his second Drivers' title and the team's fifth Constructors' title.

    <div class="fact-5">
      <img src="Resources/watching-on.avif" alt="Image of Jonathan Wheatley">
      <div class="fact-5-text">
        <h1>Jonathan Wheatley</h1>
        <p class="about-fact-5">The man behind the record-breaking pit stop team.
          <br>
          <br>
          Sporting Director Jonathan Wheatley was one of Red Bull Racing’s earliest appointments. Joining from Renault in 2006, he has been a feature on our pit wall ever since and has been highly influential in the race team’s development and successes.
          <br>
          <br>
          Jonathan started his Formula One career at Benetton as a mechanic in the early 1990s eventually rising to the position of Race Team Chief Mechanic in 2001 before choosing to leave the team at the height of its success as a championship winner with Fernando Alonso.
          <br>
          <br>
          "It was a difficult decision," he says. “Red Bull offered me a wonderful opportunity to build a race team I would want to work in. It took a while – because it takes time to create an environment in which people can thrive – but I'm very proud of what we've achieved.”
          <br>
          <br>
          And those achievements are significant, with Jonathan contributing to all of the Team’s five Constructors’ and six Drivers’ Championships. There is one that stands out though.
          <br>
          <br>
          "I've been fortunate to be involved with winning championships as a Mechanic, as a Chief Mechanic and now as a Team Manager. Of all of those I think I'd have to choose the first championship here at Red Bull as the one which really stands above the others. We won it in typical Red Bull style with everything going on: cars crashing, engine failures and everything else. We seemed to do it the hard way – but the resilience of the Team stood out. That made me proud. There was so much to soak up, so much excitement and commotion. It really was an extraordinary achievement for the Team."
          <br>
          <br>
          Among the great many jobs that fall under the aegis of the Sporting Director, pit stop performance is that which has the most resonance for racing fans. Under Jonathan’s guidance, the Oracle Red Bull Racing pit crew have become the benchmark for F1. They were the first crew to break the two-second barrier for completing a pit stop and, beyond the headline times, have raised the bar for season-long consistency.
          <br>
          <br>
          After winning the inaugural DHL Fastest Pit Stop Award in 2018 as consistently the quickest across the season, the following year the Team set a world record with a lightning-fast 1.82s stop for Max Verstappen at that year’s Brazilian Grand Prix.
          <br>
          <br>
          At the end of 2019, the crew added a second consecutive seasonal award and the Team has gone unbeaten since, with five DHL titles under its belt.
          <br>
          <br>
          “I’m tremendously proud of this Team and I love every second of working here,” says Jonathan. “We’ve created an inclusive environment where everyone is valued. We really enjoy our racing. You can see it in the people in the garage. It’s not just a cliché.”

    <div class="fact-6">
      <img src="Resources/Liam.jpeg" alt="Image of Jonathan Wheatley">
      <div class="fact-6-text">
        <h1>Liam Lawson</h1>
        <p class="about-fact-6">Throughout his young career, our Reserve driver Liam Lawson has made a habit of winning at the first time of asking.
          <br>
          <br>
          After a successful karting career, the New Zealander won on his single seater debut in the entry level Formula First. He did it again the following season, winning on his Formula Ford debut and then going on to win 14 of the 15 championship races that season to take the title.
          <br>
          <br>
          With the possibilities in his New Zealand exhausted, Liam switched to racing in Australia and at the tender age of 15 he won on his race debut in Formula 4. He ended the season as runner-up.
          <br>
          <br>
          Liam next made the big jump to European competition, joining Van Amersfoort Racing for a season in the ADAC Formula 4 championship. This time victory at the first go eluded the Kiwi but once settled into the more intense higher echelon, Liam excelled, finishing second at the end of his first campaign.
          <br>
          <br>
          
          In 2022, Liam stayed in F2 for 2022, racking up four wins and numerous podium finishes to secure third place overall. In parallel he was handed the role of reserve driver for Oracle Red Bull Racing and Scuderia AlphaTauri. He got a first taste of Formula 1 machinery with AlphaTauri at last year’s Belgian Grand Prix, before enjoying two more Friday practice sessions, at the Mexican Grand Prix with AlphaTauri and then with Oracle Red Bull Racing at the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. He stayed on at Yas Marina to round out a successful 2022 with a half day at the wheel of the RB18 at the final F1 test of the year.
